My name is Mohammad Sanad AlTaher, I am currently in my first term as a PhD student at 
[Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/)
(Corvallis, Oregon), working in the [Integrated Electronics](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS/research/integrated-electronics) 
research group, and focusing on electromagnetics.

I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from 
[Jordan University of Science and Technology](https://www.just.edu.jo/Pages/Default.aspx), where I
graduated with a 3.92/4.0 CGPA, ranking 4<sup>th</sup> in a cohort of 78 students. Additionally, I specialized
in Telecommunications and ranked 1<sup>st</sup> among others who chose this specialization, around half of the EE cohort.

During my undergraduate studies, I garnered considerable international experience in entrepreneurship, 
academics, and research by partaking in the Hult Prize in Dubai in 2019, an Erasmus+ exchange semester 
in Istanbul in 2021, and a research internship in India in 2022 respectively.

I am mostly interested in Electromagnetics, RF Telecommunications, and applied physics. I hope to work on research in space technology after
obtaining a postgraduate degree in the future.
