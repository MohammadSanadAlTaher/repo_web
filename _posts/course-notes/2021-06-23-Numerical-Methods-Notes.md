I took this course in the spring semester of 2020/2021, it was instructed by [Dr. Ahmad Ababnah](https://www.just.edu.jo/eportfolio/Pages/Default.aspx?email=aaababnah).

The notes are in reference S. Chapra and R. Canale's _Numerical Methods for Engineers_  and Dr. Ahmad's notes and lectures.

These notes are not free from mistakes, reader discretion is advised. Please [contact](/dev_site2/contact/) me if you have any concerns.
