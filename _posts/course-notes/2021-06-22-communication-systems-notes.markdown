I took this course in the spring semester of 2020/2021, it was instructed by [Dr. Jehad Ababneh](https://www.just.edu.jo/eportfolio/Pages/Default.aspx?email=ababnehj).

The notes are in reference to J. Proakis and M. Salehi's _Fundamentals of Communication Systems_, and Dr. Jehad's notes, lectures, past exams, and past homeworks.

These notes are not free from mistakes, reader discretion is advised. Please [contact](/contact/) me if you have any concerns.
