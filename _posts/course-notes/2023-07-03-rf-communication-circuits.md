I took this course in the spring semester of 2022/2023, it was instructed by [Prof. Dr. Mansour Abbadi](https://www.just.edu.jo/eportfolio/Pages/Default.aspx?email=mabbadi).

The notes are in reference to J. Smith's _Modern Communication Circuits_, and Prof. Mansour's notes, lectures, past exams, and past homeworks.

These notes are not free from mistakes, reader discretion is advised. Please [contact](/contact/) me if you have any concerns.
