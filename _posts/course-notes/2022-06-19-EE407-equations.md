I took this course in the spring semester of 2021/2022, it was instructed by [Prof. Dr. Majid Khodier](https://www.just.edu.jo/eportfolio/Pages/Default.aspx?email=majidkh).

The equations were mainly compiled from Prof. Majid's notes and lectures, as well as various textbooks such as R. E. Collin's _Antennas and Radio Wave Propagation._

Please [contact](/contact/) me if you have any concerns.
