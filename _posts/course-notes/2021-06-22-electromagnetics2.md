I took this course in the spring semester of 2020/2021, it was instructed by [Prof. Dr. Nihad Dib](https://www.just.edu.jo/eportfolio/Pages/Default.aspx?email=nihad).

The notes are in reference to M. Sadiku's _Elements of Electromagnetics_ (seventh edition) and Prof. Nihad's notes, lectures, past exams, and past quizzes.

These notes are not free from mistakes, reader discretion is advised. Please [contact](/dev_site2/contact/) me if you have any concerns.
