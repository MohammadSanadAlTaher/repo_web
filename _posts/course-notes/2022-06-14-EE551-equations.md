I took this course in the spring semester of 2021/2022, it was instructed by [Dr. Ibrahim Ghareeb](https://www.just.edu.jo/eportfolio/Pages/Default.aspx?email=ghareeb).

The equations were compiled from Dr. Ibrahim's slides and lectures, as well as J. G. Proakis and M. Salehi's _Fundamentals of Communication Systems._
