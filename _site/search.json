    "content" : "Here, I will detail how and why I built this site for those who are interested in building one for themselves.&amp;nbsp;How?As a student, using open-source/freeware was a priority. At the time of writing this post (June 24th 2021), I have not paid a single cent for this website, and I am only expecting to pay to renew my domain registration (~20USD/year).Unless major changes have been made to the services I used, you should be able to create a completely free website by following the steps outlined below.As always, feel free to reach out if any issues linger.Note: you don’t need to follow the exact order of the steps, however, this is the order I followed.&amp;nbsp;Steps:Setup: Make a GitHub account: Having a GitHub account was essential to me because I chose to host my website on GitHub Pages, which is a free hosting service for static sites. Registering a domain: Another reason why a GitHub account is essential is that if you sign up to GitHub with a student email address (i.e., the email address provided by your institution), you can register a free .me domain for a year on namecheap. To access all GitHub student benefits (including the free .me domain registration), click here. Mentioning the steps for registering a domain is redundant, as they are easy to follow and are outlined by namecheap or any other domain registry service you choose to use. Access your domain: If you’ve registered your domain to your GitHub account successfully, then going on your domain should show your GitHub username. Register for cloudflare: I found that cloudflare DNS was the most suitable for me. Hence, my next step was to sign up to cloudflare and put my domain on their Free Plan. To setup the DNS records and add cloudflare’s servers, I followed this guide by namecheap. &amp;nbsp;Interlude 1:Now that you’ve registered for all necessary services, the next steps will be downloading and installing software.To generate this website, I decided to use Jekyll, which is a simple open-source static site generator generally used for blogs and the such.As mentioned earlier, GitHub Pages host static sites only, therefore, WordPress or other similar services will not be compatible, as they require a server running a script simultaneously (i.e., WordPress sites are dynamic). In addition, Jekyll integrates really well with GitHub Pages.For the IDE, I’m using WebStorm from JetBrains. (Please refer to step 7)&amp;nbsp;Download &amp;amp; Installation:"
